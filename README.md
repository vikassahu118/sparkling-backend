The primary goal is to create a secure, scalable, and user-friendly platform that supports business growth through efficient operations and robust analytics.

- **Problem:** Businesses need an integrated platform to manage online sales, from product listing to financial reconciliation, without operational bottlenecks. Customers demand a simple, secure, and reliable shopping experience.
    
- **Goal:** To build a role-based e-commerce system that streamlines management tasks, provides clear business insights, and offers a frictionless user journey for customers.
    
- **Success Metrics:**
    
    - Increase user sign-up conversion rate by 20% in the first quarter post-launch.
        
    - Reduce order processing time by 30%.
        
    - Maintain a 99.9% platform uptime.
        
    - Achieve a customer satisfaction score of 4.5/5 stars for the shopping and checkout experience.

### 2. User Personas

- **Admin (Alex):** The system overseer. Alex is responsible for platform integrity, user management, and high-level business strategy. They need a global view of analytics and final approval authority on critical actions like promotions and product listings.
    
- **Product Manager (Priya):** Manages the digital storefront. Priya is focused on curating the product catalog, setting prices, and creating promotions to drive sales. She needs tools to add/edit products and an approval workflow for coupons.
    
- **Order Manager (Omar):** The logistics specialist. Omar ensures that customer orders are fulfilled accurately and on time. He needs to track orders from placement to delivery and handle any customer issues, returns, or exchanges efficiently.
    
- **Finance Manager (Fiona):** The financial controller. Fiona is responsible for monitoring revenue, processing refunds, and analyzing profitability. She needs access to detailed payment data and tools to manage refund requests securely.
    
- **Customer (Chris):** The end-user. Chris wants to find products easily, make secure purchases, and manage his account and order history with minimal effort.

### Explanation of Directories

- **`src/api/` (Routes):** This layer defines all the HTTP endpoints of your application (e.g., `POST /api/v1/auth/register`). Each route file maps an endpoint to a specific controller function. It's the "front door" of your backend.
    
- **`src/config/`:** Contains all setup and configuration code. This keeps credentials, database connection strings, and other environment-specific settings separate from the application logic.
    
- **`src/controllers/`:** This is where the core business logic resides. A controller receives a request from a route, interacts with models and services to process the request, and sends back a response. For example, `auth.controller.js` would contain the `registerUser` and `loginUser` functions.
    
- **`src/middlewares/`:** These are functions that run _between_ the request and the controller. They are perfect for handling concerns like **authentication** (is this user logged in?), **authorization** (does this user have permission to do this?), and **validation** (is the request body correctly formatted?). The `role.middleware.js` is critical for implementing your five user roles.
    
- **`src/models/`:** Defines the structure of your data. Each file corresponds to a collection/table in your database (e.g., MongoDB with Mongoose or SQL with Sequelize). It specifies the fields, types, and validation rules for your data.
    
- **`src/services/`:** Used to abstract logic that communicates with third-party services. For instance, instead of putting Nodemailer code directly in your controller, you create an `email.service.js` that exposes a simple `sendMagicLink(email)` function. This makes your controllers cleaner and your services reusable.
    
- **`src/utils/`:** A collection of small, reusable helper functions that don't fit anywhere else. This avoids code duplication and keeps your main logic focused.
    
- **`server.js`:** The root-level entry point. Its only jobs are to connect to the database, start the Express app defined in `app.js`, and listen for incoming connections on a specific port.
